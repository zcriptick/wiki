## What is ZXRP?

ZXRP is a resource pack that adds a large number of RP items.  
ZXRP does not change the default Minecraft textures; instead, it applies renaming to items, which then updates their textures.  
ZXRP was originally created specifically for a vanilla server but later became independent.

Currently, it is updated monthly and available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/zxrp).  
The resource pack supports versions `1.21-1.21.1`.  
The current version of the resource pack is `v3.0.0-release`.

::: danger IMPORTANT  
For the resource pack to function properly, you must download [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn).  
Without CIT Resewn or similar modifications, the resource pack **will not** work.
