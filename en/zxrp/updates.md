# About ZXRP Versions

ZXRP updates are divided into three groups: Major updates (`v1.0.0-release`, `v2.0.0-release`, `v3.0.0-release`), Minor updates (`1.1.0-release`, `2.1.0-release`), and Fixes (`1.0.1-release`).

::: details Example
This is a spoiler block.
Let's take an example: `v1.2.3-beta`                                                                                                                     
`1.0.0` - Major update version                                                                                                            
`0.2.0` - Minor update version                                                                                                               
`0.0.3` - Fix version

## Major Updates

Major updates are released 1-2 times a month with a specific name, for example: `v3.0.0-release Activity: Sounding food`. These updates add a lot of new content to the resource pack, all tied to a specific theme.

## Minor Updates

Minor updates are released 1-4 times a month, usually without a name, though there are exceptions. If a major update has been split into several smaller updates, a minor update may also have a name and will include more new content than usual. If a major update has not been split into multiple minor updates, the minor update will not have a name and will contain less new content.

::: info INFORMATION
If a major update has been split into two minor updates, the first minor update will carry the same weight as the major one, meaning its version will be written as `v1.0.0-release` instead of `v0.1.0-release`. However, the second minor update will follow the standard minor update versioning, `v0.1.0-release`.

## Fixes

Fixes are divided into several types: Bug fixes, Hotfixes, and Regular fixes. They are categorized by purpose:
- **Bug fixes** are used when multiple bugs need to be fixed.
- **Hotfixes** are used when 1-2 critical bugs need immediate fixing.
- **Regular fixes** are used when a texture or model needs to be changed, typically due to community feedback.

Fixes do not follow a set update schedule, meaning they can be released as many times as needed per month.
