# Who are we?

We are TRZ Team â€“ a 3squad team engaged in creating projects for Minecraft.  
Our team consists of three members: zcript_, dscss2, and TweaksWr.

Our team has created and continues to create many projects, such as: ZXRP, RS Engine (currently developing the first alpha version), and DisAuth (currently developing the first release).

## About the [ZXRP](/en/zxrp/) project

ZXRP is a resource pack that adds a large number of RP items.  
ZXRP does not change the default Minecraft textures; instead, it applies renaming to items, which then updates their textures.  
ZXRP was originally created specifically for a vanilla server, but later became independent from it.

Currently, it is updated monthly and available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/zxrp).

## About the RS Engine project

RS Engine is an engine for creating storyline-based seasons, similar to those of the YouTuber [MrLololoshka](https://www.youtube.com/@MrLololoshka).  
At the moment, RS Engine is in the development stage of its first Alpha version, so we cannot provide more detailed information yet.

## About the DisAuth project

DisAuth is a plugin for Minecraft servers that links a Discord account to the server.  
At the moment, DisAuth is in the development stage of its first release, so we cannot provide more detailed information yet.
